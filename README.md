This is the CNIT 155 Lab assignments that I completed. Further testing of these codes have not been conducted since 2019.... I cannot vouch for the validity or function of the code. 
This class is not taught using C# anymore... so if you are a current Purdue student takeing 155 I would not reccomend trying anythinig found here.
