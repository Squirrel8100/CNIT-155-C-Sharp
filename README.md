This is the CNIT 155 Lab assignments that I completed. Further testing of provided code has not been conducted since 2019.... I cannot vouch for the validity or function of the code. 
This class is not taught using C# anymore... so if you are a current Purdue student taking 155 I would not reccomend trying anythinig found here. 

Also not sure if all the required source files are added appropriately here.
